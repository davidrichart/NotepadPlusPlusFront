Default Notepad++ Color scheme for Sublime Text

About
=====

Notepad Plus Plus Front is a color scheme for Sublime Text 2 & 3 which try to reproduce as faithfully as possible the design of the default Notepad++ theme.

I make it because I am a new user of Sublime Text and I like very much the features of this software, but I have not succeed to get accustomed to an other code design that Notepad++ ! :-)
